Grid point data - complex packing and spatial differencing,6-ww,"First value(s) of original (undifferenced) scaled data values, followed by the overall minimum of the differences. The number of values stored is 1 greater than the order of differentiation, and the field width is described at octet 49 of data representation template 5.3",(see Note 1),64,,,Operational
Grid point data - complex packing and spatial differencing,[ww+1]-xx,"NG group reference values (X1 in the decoding formula), each of which is encoded using the number of bits specified in octet 20 of data representation template 5.0. Bits set to zero shall be appended where necessary to ensure this sequence of numbers ends on an octet boundary",,,,,Operational
Grid point data - complex packing and spatial differencing,[xx+1]-nn,Same as for data representation template 7.2,,,,,Operational
