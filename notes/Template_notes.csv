2,"A group containing only missing values (of either type) will be encoded as a constant group (null width, no associated data) and the group reference will have all bits set to 1 for primary type, and all bits set to 1, except the last bit set to 0, for secondary type."
3,"A logarithm pre-processing algorithm is used to fit the variability range into one or two order of magnitudes before using the simple packing algorithm. It requires a parameter (B) to assure that all values passed to the logarithm function arepositive. Thus scaled values are Z = ln (Y+B), where Y are the original values, ln is the natural logarithm (or Napierian)function and B is chosen so that Y+B > 0."
4,"A quasi-regular grid is only defined for appropriate grid scanning modes. Either rows or columns, but not both simultaneously, may have variable numbers of points or variable spacing.

The code values of the NP partitions are expressed in octets 14 to 14+2NP-1. The NP partitions are linked by the normalization formula stating that the sum of all the NP partitions must be equal to a normalization term (N) on each point of the grid.
7,"An increment of zero means that the statistical processing is the result of a continuous (or near-continuous) process, not the processing of a number of discrete samples. Examples of such continuous processes are the temperatures measured by analogue maximum and minimum thermometers or thermographs, and the rainfall measured by a rain gauge."
8,"As an extra option, substitute value(s) for missing data may be specified. If not wished (or not applicable), all bits should be set to 1 for relevant substitute value(s)."
9,"Basic angle of the initial production domain and subdivisions of this basic angle are provided to manage cases where the recommended unit of 10-6 degrees is not applicable to describe the longitudes and latitudes, and direction increments. For these descriptors, the unit is equal to the ratio of the basic angle and the subdivisions number. For ordinary cases, zero and missing values should be coded, equivalent to the respective values of 1 and 106 (10-6 degrees unit)."
10,"Best practice follows for choosing the B pre-processing parameter.(a) If the data set minimum value is positive, B can be safely put to zero.(b) If the data set minimum is zero, all values must be scaled to become greater than zero and B can be equal to the minimum positive value in the data set."

72,"Spatial differencing is a pre-processing before group splitting at encoding time. It is intended to reduce the size of sufficiently smooth fields, when combined with a splitting scheme as described in data representation template 5.2. Atorder 1, an initial field of values f is replaced by a new field of values g, where g1 = f1, g2 = f2 – f1, …, gn = fn – fn–1. Atorder 2, the field of values g is itself replaced by a new field of values h, where h1 = f1, h2 = f2, h3 = g3 – g2, …, hn = gn –gn–1. To keep values positive, the overall minimum of the resulting field (either gmin or hmin) is removed.

75,"The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) recommended standard for lossless data compression is the standard used by space agencies for the compression of scientific data transmitted from satellites and other space instruments. CCSDS recommended standard for lossless data compression is a very fast predictive compression algorithm based on the extended-Rice algorithm. It uses Golomb–Rice codes for entropy coding. The sequence of prediction errors is divided into blocks. Each block is compressed using a two-pass algorithm. In the first pass, the best coding method for the whole block is determined. In the second pass, the output of the marker of the selected coding method is encoded as ancillary information along with prediction errors.The coding methods include:• Golomb–Rice codes of a chosen rank• Unary code for transformed pairs of prediction errors• Fixed-length natural binary code if the block is found to be incompressible• Signalling to the decoder empty block if all prediction errors are zeroes"
76,"The essence of the complex packing method is to subdivide a field of values into NG groups, where the values in each group have similar sizes. In this procedure, it is necessary to retain enough information to recover the group lengths upon decoding. The NG group lengths for any given field can be described by Ln = ref + Kn x len_inc, n = 1, NG, where ref is given by octets 38-41 and len_inc by octet 42. The NG values of K (the scaled group lengths) are stored in the data section, each with the number of bits specified by octet 47. Since the last group is a special case which may not be able to be specified by this relationship, the length of the last group is stored in octets 43-46."

83,"The intent of this template is to scale the grid point data to obtain the desired precision, if appropriate, and then subtract the reference value from the scaled field, as is done using data representation template 5.0. After this, the resulting grid point field can be treated as a greyscale image and encoded into the CCSDS recommended standard for lossless data compression code stream format. To unpack the data field, the CCSDS recommended standard for lossless data compression code stream is decoded back into an image, and the original field is obtained from the image data as described in regulation 92.9.4, Note 4."

86,"The number given refers to a specific grid required for formulating differential operators. The grid may consist of acentre and an arbitrary surrounding polygon. As model variables may be defined on vertices of the polygons or in the middle of a polygon edge, this generates some different grid descriptions, because each of those is defining their own centre and surrounding polygon. Each of these dependent grids needs their own set of centrelongitude/latitude and the longitude/latitude of the boundary polygon vertices. The following picture shows atriangle as base, a hexagon around the triangle's vertices and a quadrilateral around the edge midpoints.(a) Triangles (i) (pressure, temperature, ...)(b) Quadrilaterals (l) (wind velocity ...)(c) Hexagons (or pentagons, respectively) (v) (vorticity, ...)"

88,"The order of the data points should remain as specified in the scanning mode flags (Flag table 3.4) set in the appropriate grid definition template, even though the JPEG 2000 standard specifies that an image is stored starting at the top left corner. Assuming that the encoding software is expecting the image data in raster order (left to right across rows for each row), users should set the image width to Ni (or Nx) and the height to Nj (or Ny) if bit 3 of the scanning mode flag equals 0 (adjacent points in i (x) order), when encoding the ""image"". If bit 3 of the scanning mode flags equals 1 (adjacent points in j (y) order), it may be advantageous to set the image width to Nj (or Ny) and the height to Ni (or Nx)."
89,"The order of the data points should remain as specified in the scanning mode flags (Flag table 3.4) set in the appropriate grid definition template, even though the PNG standard specifies that an image is stored starting at the top left corner andscans each row from left to right, starting with the top row.

The triangles are combined to nd quadrangles,the so-called diamonds (e.g. if nd = 10, two of the icosahedron triangles form a diamond, and if nd = 5, 4 icosahedron triangles form a diamond). There are two resolution values called n2 and n3 describing the division of each triangle side.Each triangle side is divided into ni equal parts, where ni = 3n3 x 2n2 with n3 either equal to 0 or to 1. In the example in GRIB Attachment I, the numbering order of the rectangles is anti-clockwise with a view from the pole point on both hemispheres. Diamonds 1 to 5 are northern hemisphere and diamonds 6 to 10 are southern hemisphere."
91,"The pentagonal representation of resolution is general. Some common truncations are special cases of the pentagonal one: Triangular: M = J = K Rhomboidal: K = J + M Trapezoidal: K = J, K > M [OR] See the Note under grid definition template 3.50 – spherical harmonic coefficients."
92,The position of overall minimum after initial data values is a choice that enables less software management.
93,"The purpose of this template is to scale the grid point data to obtain the desired precision, if appropriate, and then subtract out the reference value from the scaled field as is done using data representation template 5.0. After this, the resulting grid point field can be treated as a greyscale image and is then encoded into the JPEG 2000 code streamformat. To unpack the data field, the JPEG 2000 code stream is decoded back into an image, and the original field is obtained from the image data as described in Regulation 92.9.4, Note 4."

129,This template is deprecated. Template 4.31 should be used instead.
130,"This template is experimental, was not validated at the time of publication and should be used only for bilateral previously agreed tests."
131,"This template is experimental, was not validated at the time of publication and should be used only for bilateral previously agreed tests. (Octets 35-50 are very similar to octets 43-58 of product definition template 4.8, but the meaning of some fields differs slightly.)"
132,"This template should not be used when the data points are not available on a rectangular grid, such as occurs if some data points are bit-mapped out or if section 3 describes a quasi-regular grid. If it is necessary to use this template on such a grid, the data field can be treated as a one-dimensional image where the height is set to 1 and the width is set to the total number of data points specified in octets 6–9."
133,This template should not be used. Product definition template 4.0 should be used instead.
134,This template was not validated at the time of publication and should be used with caution. Please report any use to the WMO Secretariat to assist with validation.
136,"Three parameters define a general latitude/longitude coordinate system, formed by a general rotation of the sphere. One choice for these parameters is: (a) The geographic latitude in degrees of the southern pole of the coordinate system, θp for example; (b) The geographic longitude in degrees of the southern pole of the coordinate system, λp for example; (c) The angle of rotation in degrees about the new polar axis (measured clockwise when looking from the southern to the northern pole) of the coordinate system, assuming the new axis to have been obtained by first rotating the sphere through λp degrees about the geographic polar axis, and then rotating through (90 + θp) degrees so that the southern pole moved along the (previously rotated) Greenwich meridian. [OR] See Note 2 under grid definition template 3.1 – rotated latitude/longitude (or equidistant cylindrical, or Plate Carrée)."
137,"Values ordering within the packed data is done according to the source of grid definition, skipping the values processed in the unpacked subset."
138,Values ordering within the unpacked subset is defined according to the source of grid definition associated with the data.
139,"Years before year 1 shall be coded as defined in ISO 8601 (year 1 is followed by year 0). If applicable, year -1 or before shall be indicated by setting the most significant bit of octets 13-14 and 24-25 to ""1"" in accordance with Regulation 92.1.5."
140,"This represents the length of time over which the statistical processing was applied. The local time defined in section 1 represents the end of this processing. For instance, a value of 24 h corresponds to a statistical processing between the previous day at local time and this day at local time."
141,"This represents the number of statistically processed fields (or stripes) used to create the composite local time field. For instance, a value of 8 means that 8 statistically processed fields have been used in the processing, each of them representing a section of 45 degrees of longitude (360/8) centred around the UTC time corresponding to the local time."
142,"This is the number of forecasts and time steps used to create the statistically processed fields. These implicitly have the same statistical process as defined in octet 27. If a forecast has 2 time increments (3 hourly day 1 to 5 then 6 hourly), it should be encoded as 2 forecasts with the same reference time, using the appropriate starting forecast time and time increments."
143,"This also represents the length of time range of the statistically processed fields. For instance, to create a 24 h accumulation (encoded in octets 29-32), we could use several 3 h accumulations, or 6 h accumulations, a mixture of the two, etc."
144,"This is the number of forecasts and time steps used to create the statistically processed fields. These implicitly have the same statistical process as defined in octet 30.

156,The reference time in octets 32-38 and the forecast time together define the beginning of the overall time interval.
157,"The reference and forecast times are successively set to their initial values plus or minus the increment, as defined by the type of time increment (one of octets (60+12(NC-1)), (73+12(NC-1)), (85+12(NC-1)), ...). For all but the innermost (last) time range, the next inner range is then processed using these reference and forecast times as the initial reference and forecast times."
158,"For most templates, details of the packing process are described in regulation 92.9.4. This template is only valid for the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems Recommendation for Space Data System Standards, Lossless Data Compression, CCSDS 121.0-B-2, Blue Book, May 2012."

162,"The units of the wave directions are degree true."
163,"Wave periods should be specified in seconds."
164,"See notes under Code table 4.101 for details."
165,"'Number of reference period time range' is used to define an outer and, if needed, one or more inner loops. The outer loop gives the overall date and time range of the reference period and the inner loop(s) specify a sub-period over all time instances defined in the outer loop in terms of the time unit defined by 'Reference period indicator of unit for time increment'. Typically the outer loop defines a number of years and inner loop defines the date and time range within each year: for instance 'every January for 30 years'."
166,"The grid is composed of 12 rhomboids, each rhomboid has nsides**2 grid boxes within a rhomboid. When using the nested ordering, nsides must be a power of 2: nsides = 2**k where k=0,1,2,3 ...."
167,"Longitude of the first grid point of the first rhomboid. The 12 rhomboids are numbered as in the figure 5 of the original paper describing the HEALPix and the longitude of the first point of the first rhomboid corresponds to the diagonal dividing rhomboid 0 and 8 vertically (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/427976). The longitude is given in microdegrees. For instance, 45.0 degrees is encoded as 45,000,000."
