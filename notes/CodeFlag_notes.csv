Generally, the prime meridian defined in the geodetic system WGS-84 can be safely assumed to be the longitudinal origin. However, because these code figures do not specify the longitudinal origin explicitly, it is suggested to contact the originating centre if high precision coordinates are needed, in order to obtain the precise details of the coordinate system used (effective as from 16 November 2016)."

175,"Spatially analyzed quality indicator, according to OPERA II (Holleman I., Michelson D., Galli G., Germann U., and Peura M., 2006: Quality information for radars and radar data. OPERA II deliverable OPERA_2005_19), normalized to between 0 (poorest quality) to 1 (best quality)."
176,"'Undetected' means that the received radar signal is at or below noise level."
177,"‘No data’ describes that a data point is out of range or in a blanked sector."
178,"‘Implausible data / outliers’ refers to values that are not physically plausible."
179,"BFI2D is calculated by dividing the BFI by an expression that increases with the directional spread and decreases with the peakedness. It comes from the consideration that an increase of the directional spread reduces the excess of kurtosis, which is not taken into account in the BFI alone. Mori, N., M. Onorato, and P. A. E. M. Janssen, 2011: On the Estimation of the Kurtosis in Directional Sea States for Freak Wave Forecasting. J. Phys. Oceanogr., 41, 1484–1497, https://doi.org/10.1175/2011JPO4542.1"
180,"Crest-trough correlation is an estimate of the auto-correlation between the crest heights and the trough depths. In narrow-banded seas this parameter is quite high, because crests and troughs are approximately the same size. Gemmrich, J., Cicon, L. Generation mechanism and prediction of an observed extreme rogue wave. Sci Rep 12, 1718 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-05671-4"
181,"This is a metric that quantifies the wave-induced mechanical fatigue on the sea-ice pack (0 means broken, 1 means solid). This metric only makes sense in the presence of sea ice."
182,"The x- and y- components of the wave radiative stress to sea-ice are not necessarily equivalent to the u- and v- components (eastward/northward). The x- and y- components strictly follow the defined coordinate system which may or may not follow the eastward and northward directions."
183,"The atmospheric surface momentum flux is what the atmosphere is losing at the surface of the ocean. The surface momentum flux into the ocean is the momentum flux that is entering the ocean and driving the ocean circulation. The difference is that part of the atmospheric momentum flux goes into the waves and not into the ocean circulation or part of the momentum contained in the wave field that is transferred to the ocean when waves break. In short, the ocean surface has waves which modulate the momentum transfer between the atmosphere and the ocean interior."
184,"Probability that a fire will be observed in the grid box."
185,"Probability that a lightning strike will ignite a fire, leading to a detectable fire in the grid box."
186,"Water surface elevation in the river and floodplains defined by the model as base elevation."
187,"Water flow from the groundwater storage to the main river channel."
188,"The amount of water stored in the main river channel and on the floodplain within a grid cell. The term storage refers to the total volume of water. This entry is the sum of entries 11 and 12."
189,"River flow velocity computed along the river network. It represents the mean speed of water movement in a cross-section of the river channel."
190,"Mean mass diameter is the diameter of a particle representing the mean mass of the particle size distribution."
191,"Estimated maximum diameter is the empirical estimate of the maximum particle size, based on a particle size distribution or its moments."
