Therefore, defining the shape of the Earth alone without coordinate system axis origins is ambiguous. Generally, the prime meridian defined in the geodetic system WGS-84 can be safely assumed to be the longitudinal origin. However, because these code figures do not specify the longitudinal origin explicitly, it is suggested to contact the originating centre if high precision coordinates are needed, in order to obtain the precise details of the coordinate system used (effective as from 16 November 2016).",2,na,"applies to code figures 0,1,3,6 and 7"
