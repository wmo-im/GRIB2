The discipline and category are an important part of any product definition, so it is possible to have the same parameter name in more than one category. For example, “water temperature” indiscipline 10 (oceanographic products), category 4 (subsurface properties) is used for reporting water temperature in the ocean or open sea, and is not the same as “water temperature” indiscipline 1 (hydrological products), category 2 (inland water and sediment properties), which is used for reporting water temperature in freshwater lakes and rivers.","[[4.2,table]]"
120,"When a non-missing value is used from this code table, the original data value is a quality value associated with the parameter defined by octets 10 and 11 of the product definition template.","[[4.16,table]]"
121,"With respect to code figures 0, 1, 3, 6 and 7, coordinates can only be unambiguously interpreted, if the coordinate reference system in which they are embedded is known. Therefore, defining the shape of the Earth alone without coordinate system axis origins is ambiguous. Generally, the prime meridian defined in the geodetic system WGS-84 can be safely assumed to be the longitudinal origin. However, because these code figures do not specify the longitudinal origin explicitly, it is suggested to contact the originating centre if high precision coordinates are needed, in order to obtain the precise details of the coordinate system used (effective as from 16 November 2016).","[[3.2,0],[3.2,1],[3.2,3],[3.2,6],[3.2,7]]"
